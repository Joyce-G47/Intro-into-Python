#Functions

 Functions are block of reusable code that is made easy to read and understand every time it's called each time the operation needs to be carried out.

def: This keyword is used to define a function.

function_name: This is the name of the function. It should be descriptive and follow the naming conventions. Function names are followed by parentheses ().

parameters: These are the inputs to the function. You can pass zero or more parameters to a function.

Docstring: It's an optional string that describes what the function does. It's good practice to include docstrings to document your functions.

return: This keyword is used to return a value from the function. A function can return zero or more values.

#Control Flow Statement

A program’s control flow is the order in which the program’s code executes.

The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.

Python has three types of control structures:

 

·         Sequential - default mode

·         Selection - used for decisions and branching

·         Repetition - used for looping, i.e., repeating a piece of code multiple times.

#Modules

In Python, a module is a file that contains Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py added. For example, if you have a file named example.py, it can be imported as a module in another Python script.

Modules are used to organize Python code and make it more manageable. They allow you to logically organize your Python code, group related code into a single file, and reuse code in different programs.
