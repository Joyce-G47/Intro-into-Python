 Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.
 Python was conceived in the late 1980s and Guido van Rossum started implementing it at CWI in the Netherlands in December 1989. It is a relatively simple language that includes a standard library that provides modules for a large number of processes that programs deal with. This approach keeps Python simple yet reliable programming language..
 Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
